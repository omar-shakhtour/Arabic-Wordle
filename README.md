# Arabic Wordle Game

This application was built as my senior project for my BA in Computer Science. I was tasked with developing a gamified educational application. I decided to build the classic Worlde game but for the Arabic language. This application is great for one seeking to improve their vocabulary. The game uses three-letter Arabic root words, which should help one significantly expand their vocabulary, as the Arabic language is based on root words.

## Application Demo

https://quranic-arabic-wordle.vercel.app/

## Built With

* Svelte
* JavaScript
* HTML/CSS

## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
cd svelte-app
npm install
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.

By default, the server will only respond to requests from localhost. To allow connections from other computers, edit the `sirv` commands in package.json to include the option `--host 0.0.0.0`.
